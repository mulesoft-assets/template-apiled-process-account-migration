# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for API Led Connectivity approach of running an enterprise environment.

This Anypoint Template is a REST API implemented using APIkit and RAML definition. The API uses JSON as exchange format. Included are example requests and responses. This Template, also incorporates the System APIs, first for fetching Accounts from source(A) instance, and second for creating or updating Accounts in destination(B) instance. 

Below are the endpoints that are implemented.

### POST /migrateAccounts
This endpoint will trigger migration of Accounts from source instance(A) to destination instance(B) using API Led Connectivity System API.   

Look at the included self-descriptive RAML definition and the corresponding flows to learn more about the flows.


# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get API Led Connectivity Process API for Accounts running.


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
In this section we detail the way you should run your Anypoint Template on your computer.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)


### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)
+ Anypoint Studio Project from External Location
+ Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml
+ Mule ESB Configuration XML from External Location

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on your Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover your mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`


### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this would be `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**.


### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with an easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub. For the specific steps to do so, please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Mule Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:

### Application configuration
**Common configuration**

+ http.port `9090`

**APIs configuration**

+ api.domain `your-sfdc-api.cloudhub.io`
+ api.basePath `/api`

+ system.api.a.domain `your-source-a-system-api.cloudhub.io`
+ system.api.a.http.port `9091`
+ system.api.a.basePath `/api1`

+ system.api.b.domain `your-destination-b-system-api.cloudhub.io`
+ system.api.b.http.port `9092`
+ system.api.b.basePath `/api2`


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give an overview of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it accordingly to fit your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you can find in this application:

* [process-api.xml](#processapi)

## process-api.xml<a name="processapi"/>

A functional aspect of this Anypoint Template implemented in this XML is to migrate Accounts from source(A) instance to the destination(B) instance for a represented use case. You can customize and extend the logic of this Anypoint Template in this XML to more specifically meet your needs.

Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are also set in this file. **Even though you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.
